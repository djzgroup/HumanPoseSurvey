# HumanPoseSurvey
## Deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation under different supervision manners: A survey
3D human pose estimation is an essential technique for many computer vision applications such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, digital entertainment, etc. Meanwhile, it is also a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and occlusion problems. Lately, deep learning method for 3D human pose estimation has attracted increasing attention due to the success of learning based 2D human pose estimation. Against this backdrop, numerous methods have being proposed to address different problems in this area. Generally, these methods consist of the body modeling, learning based pose estimation and regularization for refinement. This paper provides an extensive literature survey of recent literatures about Deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation, covering the aspects of human body model, 3D single-person pose estimation, 3D multi-person human pose estimation and regularization. Moreover, as deep learning methods can be categorized according to supervision manners which are based on quite different philosophies and are applicable for diverse scenarios, this paper provides a classification for both 3D single-person and multi-person pose estimation methods based on their supervision manners, i.e. unsupervised methods, fully-supervised methods, weakly-supervised methods, semi-supervised methods, and self-supervised methods. At last, this paper also enlists the contemporary and widely used datasets, compares performances of reviewed methods and discusses promising research directions.

## Single-person and Multi-person

- ***Single-person 3D pose estimation*** falls into two categories: two-stage and One-stage methods. 
  - *Two-stage methods* involve two steps, first, 2D joint locations are obtained by 2D keypoints detection models, then 2D keypoints are lifted to 3D keypoints by deep learning methods. 
  - *One-stage methods* mean regressing 3D joint locations directly from a RGB image. These methods require many training data with 3D annotations, but manual annotation is costly and demanding.
- ***Multi-person 3D pose estimation*** is divided into two categories: top-down and bottom-up methods. 
  - *Top-down methods* first detect the human candidates and then apply single-person pose estimation for each of them. 
  - *Bottom-up methods* first detect all keypoints followed by grouping them into different people. 

## Input form

- ***RGB image-based methods*** take static images as input, only taking spatial context into account, which differs from video-based methods.
- ***Video-based methods*** meet more challenges than image-based methods, such as temporal information processing, correspondence between spatial information and temporal information and motion changes in different frames, etc.


## Supervision form
- ***Unsupervised methods*** do not require any multi-view image data, 3D skeletons, correspondences between 2D-3D points, or use previously learned 3D priors during training. Self-supervised methods which can also solve the issue, deficiency of 3D data, have become popular in recent years. *Self-supervised methods* is a form of unsupervised learning where the data provides the supervision.
- ***Fully-supervised methods*** rely on large training sets annotated with ground-truth 3D positions coming from multi-view motion capture systems.
- ***Weakly-supervised methods*** access multiple cues for weak supervision, such as, a) paired 2D ground-truth, b) unpaired 3D ground-truth (3D pose without the corresponding image), c) multi-view image pair, d) camera parameters in a multi-view setup, etc.
- ***Semi-supervised methods*** use part of annotated data (e.g. 10 percent of 3D labels), which means labeled training data is scarce.


## The taxonomy of deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation
Both *single-person 3D pose estimation* and *multi-person 3D pose estimation* combined with different supervision forms could derive various branches as described in the figure below.

It is an unbalanced tree describing deep learning based 3D human pose estimation. Multi-person 3D pose estimation has received less interest compared to single-person 3D pose estimation. Also, video-based 3D pose estimation is less studied than image-based 3D pose estimation. Another interesting sight is that fully-supervised methods are presented in each sub-category, which may indicate that fully-supervised methods are helped to investigate a research area at the beginning.
